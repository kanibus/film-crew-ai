Draft V3 - Health Vignettes
“Health Industries Intro: Driving the Leading Edge”

Overall vision: 
PwC is driving clients to the leading edge with the firm’s vision for the future of healthcare. Let’s travel to 2035 to see just a few ways healthcare will be more accessible, personalized and streamlined through innovation and technology.

Dr. Jalen Roy is the thread through this story. In 2025, Dr. Roy is overworked & exhausted. Then we travel 10 years into the future where healthcare has been modernized, and Dr. Roy attends to three patients. We end with Dr. Roy sleeping soundly as an AI-powered avatar boots up for the overnight shift.
##

Character breakdown:
Dr. Jalen Roy, 40’s, African-American. His mother is also a physician (retired) and he has a teenage daughter. In 2025, Dr. Roy is burnt out and falling behind in life responsibilities.

Michael, 62, Hispanic, overweight. He lives in a small farmhouse (lower socioeconomic) with his family 170 miles from the nearest hospital. Michael has atrial fibrillation (A-fib), but it’s under control with medication and regular check-ins with his doctor.

Lanie, 40’s, white, dark hair, average build. Middle class home (middle or upper middle), mom of three young children and taking care of her elderly father with Alzheimer’s. 

Priya, 76 years old, lives in a midwestern city. She’s relatively healthy and has a home health system that keeps her updated on her biomarkers. (Urban setting/middle class).
