FADE IN:

INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY

A busy coffee shop filled with the morning rush. SARAH (30s, tired eyes, worn backpack) enters and scans the crowded room.

SARAH
(to herself)
Where are you...

She spots JAMES (40s, business suit, nervous energy) at a corner table. He waves tentatively.

JAMES
Sarah? Over here.

Sarah approaches the table cautiously. James stands, uncertain whether to shake hands or hug. They settle for an awkward handshake.

SARAH
It's been a long time.

JAMES
Too long. Please, sit.

They both sit. The silence is heavy.

JAMES (CONT'D)
I wasn't sure you'd come.

SARAH
I almost didn't.

A WAITRESS approaches.

WAITRESS
Can I get you anything?

SARAH
Just coffee. Black.

The waitress nods and leaves. James fidgets with his cup.

JAMES
I know I don't deserve your time--

SARAH
(interrupting)
Then why am I here?

JAMES
Because I need to tell you the truth. About everything.

Sarah leans back, arms crossed.

SARAH
The truth? After fifteen years?

JAMES
I know how it sounds. But there are things you don't know. Things about that night.

SARAH
(sharper)
Which night? The night you disappeared? Or the night Mom died alone because you weren't there?

James winces. The waitress returns with Sarah's coffee. They wait in tense silence until she leaves.

JAMES
Both. They're connected.

SARAH
(sarcastic)
Of course they are.

JAMES
Sarah, please. Just hear me out. After that, if you never want to see me again, I'll understand.

Sarah stares at him for a long moment, then nods slightly.

SARAH
You have ten minutes.

FADE OUT.
