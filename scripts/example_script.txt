FADE IN:

INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY

A bustling coffee shop in downtown. Sunlight streams through large windows, illuminating dust particles in the air.

SARAH (30s, professional attire, nervous energy) enters and scans the room.

SARAH (V.O.)
Every morning starts the same way. The city wakes up, and so do I. But today... today would be different.

She spots JAMES (40s, worn jacket, tired eyes) sitting alone in a corner booth.

SARAH
(approaching cautiously)
James?

JAMES
(looking up, surprised)
Sarah... I didn't think you'd come.

SARAH
(sitting down)
You disappeared for three years. No calls, no explanation. Why now?

JAMES (V.O.)
I had no choice. They threatened to hurt you if I didn't disappear.

JAMES
There are things you don't know. Things I couldn't tell you then.

SARAH
(angry)
Couldn't? Or wouldn't?

CUT TO:

EXT. CITY STREET - DAY (FLASHBACK)

Three years earlier. James walks quickly down a crowded street, constantly looking over his shoulder.

JAMES (V.O.)
The Castellano family doesn't give second chances. When you're in, you're in for life.

INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY (PRESENT)

SARAH
(leaning forward)
Tell me everything. Now.

JAMES
(sighs)
It started with a simple job...

FADE OUT.
