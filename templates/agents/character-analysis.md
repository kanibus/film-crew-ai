   - Back view (hair, posture details)

2. **Emotion Cards (Genre-Calibrated)**
   Close-ups:
   - Joyful (comedy: broad, drama: subtle)
   - Angry (thriller: contained, comedy: exaggerated)
   - Sad (drama: raw, comedy: understated)
   - Surprised (horror: terror, comedy: double-take)
   - Contemplative (drama: deep, comedy: confused)
   
   Full-body:
   - Joyful movement

   - Defeated posture

3. **Character Details**

   - Props and accessories
   - Physical mannerisms
   - Micro-expressions
