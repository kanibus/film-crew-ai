“Health Industries Intro: Driving the Leading Edge”

Overall vision: 
PwC is driving clients to the leading edge with the firm’s vision for the future of healthcare. Let’s travel to 2035 to see just a few ways healthcare will be more accessible, personalized and streamlined through innovation and technology.

Dr. Jalen Roy is the thread through this story. In 2025, Dr. Roy is overworked & exhausted. Then we travel 10 years into the future where healthcare has been modernized, and Dr. Roy attends to three patients. We end with Dr. Roy sleeping soundly as an AI-powered avatar boots up for the overnight shift.
