FADE IN:

EXT. CITY STREET - DAWN

The sun rises over a sleeping city. Empty streets glisten with morning dew.

SARAH (V.O.)
Every morning starts the same way. The city wakes up, and so do I. But today... today would be different.

A lone jogger passes by. Birds begin their morning chorus.

CUT TO:

INT. SARAH'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - DAWN

SARAH (30s, determined eyes) sits up in bed, already awake. She looks at a photo on her nightstand - a younger version of herself with JAMES.

SARAH (V.O.)
Three years. Three years since he disappeared without a word.

She gets up, determined.

INT. SARAH'S APARTMENT - KITCHEN - MORNING

Sarah makes coffee. Her phone buzzes. A text: "He's back. Coffee shop on 5th. -Anonymous"

SARAH
(to herself)
What the hell...

She grabs her jacket.

EXT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY

Sarah approaches the familiar coffee shop. She hesitates at the door.

SARAH (V.O.)
Was this a mistake? Some wounds are better left closed.

She takes a deep breath and enters.

INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY

Busy morning crowd. Sarah scans the room. There - in the corner - JAMES (40s, worn, nervous).

Their eyes meet. Time stops.

JAMES
Sarah...

SARAH
(cold)
James.

She walks over, sits down.

JAMES
Thank you for coming.

SARAH
I almost didn't. Why now?

JAMES
Because I finally know the truth about that night. About why I had to leave.

SARAH (V.O.)
His words hung in the air like smoke. The truth. After all this time, did I even want to know?

WAITRESS (20s, cheerful) approaches.

WAITRESS
What can I get you folks?

SARAH
Black coffee.

JAMES
Same.

The waitress leaves. Awkward silence.

SARAH
You have five minutes.

JAMES
Sarah, I was protecting you. There were people... dangerous people.

SARAH
(angry)
Protecting me? You destroyed me!

INT. COFFEE SHOP - FLASHBACK - NIGHT (3 YEARS AGO)

Quick flash: James packing frantically. A photo of Sarah falls to the floor.

JAMES (V.O.)
I had no choice. They threatened to hurt you if I didn't disappear.

INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY (PRESENT)

Back to the present. Sarah's eyes well up.

SARAH
Who? Who were these people?

JAMES
My past caught up with me. Before I met you, I worked for... let's just say, the wrong people.

SARAH
(sarcastic)
How cryptic.

JAMES
I'm trying to protect you even now. The less you knowâ€”

SARAH
(interrupting)
No. No more protection. Truth or I walk.

James looks around nervously.

JAMES
(whispered)
I was a courier. For the Castellano family.

Sarah's face goes white.

SARAH (V.O.)
The Castellano family. Even I knew that name. Everyone in the city did. And now I understood why he ran.

EXT. CITY STREET - TWILIGHT - FLASHBACK

James walking alone, briefcase in hand. Shadowy figures follow.

JAMES (V.O.)
I thought I could leave that life behind. Start fresh with you. But you can't just walk away from the family.

INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY (PRESENT)

SARAH
So you just... left? Without a word?

JAMES
If I had told you, you would have tried to come with me. Or worse, tried to help. I couldn't risk it.

The coffee arrives. Neither touches it.

SARAH
And now? Why come back?

JAMES
(hopeful)
Castellano is dead. His son took over, gave amnesty to everyone. I'm free, Sarah. We could...

SARAH
(standing)
We could what? Pick up where we left off? Pretend the last three years didn't happen?

JAMES
Sarah, please...

SARAH (V.O.)
I looked at him - really looked at him. The man I once loved. The man who broke me. Could I forgive him?

She turns to leave, then stops.

SARAH
I need time. To think.

JAMES
I'll wait. As long as it takes.

Sarah walks out.

EXT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY

Sarah exits, takes a deep breath. The city continues around her, oblivious.

SARAH (V.O.)
Some choices define us. This would be one of them. But not today. Today, I just needed to breathe.

She walks away, disappearing into the crowd.

FADE OUT.

THE END
